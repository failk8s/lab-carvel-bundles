A partial solution to this problem of disconnected installs comes in the form
of the Carvel templating, packaging and deployment tools

Carvel is an open source project created by VMware and is used as a key
component in managing installations of extensions and applications to Tanzu
Kubernetes Grid (TKG) clusters.

Some like to try and compare Carvel to other templating tools for Kubernetes
such as Kustomize and Helm. Although Carvel can be used to perform tasks
which those others tools handle, that is only a subset of the functionality
that the Carvel tools can be used for. The Carvel tools aim to solve much
bigger problems than Kustomize and Helm can handle, including helping with
the task of installation to disconnected environments.
